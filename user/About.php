    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div>
    Periwinkle Bag is a brand discovered by Nasuha Zakaria in early 2021. Interested with online fashion, she started her business on
    social media before pursuing it on a website. Periwinkle means a purple-blue colour like that of a periwinkle flower.
    The reason Periwinkle name was chosen is because Nasuha wants the brand's theme colour to be Periwinkle. It brings youth and feminine energy to the brand.
    Periwinkle sells many types of bags that include sling bags, tote bags and shoulder bags. The
    bags are known for their quality and affordable price. Besides, the cute and latest design attracts mostly young girls to buy our products.
    We are glad that currently we can advertise our products and provide services online in hope to satisfy our future customers.
